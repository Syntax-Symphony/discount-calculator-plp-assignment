# discount-calculator-plp-assignment

This is a simple Python program that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.

## Features
- Takes user input for the original price and discount percentage.
- Applies discount only if it is **20% or more**.
- Displays the final price after discount or the original price if no discount was applied.

## How It Works
1. User is prompted to enter:
   - Original price
   - Discount percentage
2. The `calculate_discount` function checks if the discount is 20% or more.
3. If true, it applies the discount and returns the new price.
4. Otherwise, it returns the original price.
